DLE-XP history

25 oct 05

v1.4.33

o Added texture filters.

24 oct 05

v1.4.32

o New: Textures will now be sorted by their type/function/appearance, i.e. first the rocks (gray, brown, red, blue, green, sand, lava, water),
  next steel, then concrete and wall textures, floors, ceilings, grates, fans, lights, signs, energy and force fields, tech stuff, doors.
  Next new feature will be a texture filter based on these texture properties.
  
22 oct 05

v1.4.31

o Fixed: Issuing a "previous line" command switched to the next line.
o Fixed: Unjoining points would destroy the level.

13 oct 05

v1.4.30

o Fixed: Editing/displaying the strength of Descent 1 shield damage and energy drain switches.

11 oct 05

v1.4.29

o Fixed: Crash when aligning textures and only using secondary textures.
o Improved: Texture alignment.

v1.4.28

o Fixed: Texture selection not working properly with partial texture display, if the texture list was 
  bigger than what fitted into the texture view and was scrolled down.

10 oct 05

v1.4.27

o Fixed: Overloaded textures that were reset to their defaults were still kept in the pog files,
  leading to D2X-W32 not overloading them with their highres equivalents.
o Fixed: TGA custom textures displayed upside down.

5 oct 05

v1.4.26

o Fixed: Level names from mission files containing whitespace characters (e.g. blanks) were mutilated
o Fixed: When creating a new level, no extension was added to the level file name

1 oct 05

v1.4.25

o Fixed: DLE-XP sometimes screwed up levels when splitting cubes.
o Fixed: Joining the current side with the wrong cube.
o New: Support for custom palettes (RGB palettes with 256 1-byte color entries)

12 jul 05

v1.4.24

o Fixed: Image type not properly stored when loading a TGA image with the same size as the overloaded
  default image. This would lead to transparency information loss for such images.

8 jul 05

v1.4.23

o New: Transparency can now be set for every wall type.

7 jul 05

v1.4.22

o Fixed: Render depth settings weren't handled properly in wireframe view.
o Fixed: Buggy TGA handling.
o Fixed: Display of textures where their height is larger than their width (i.e. textures containing
  animations).
o Improved: Hit test for segment selection.

5 jul 05

v1.4.21

o Improved: DLE-XP will now accept textures where width and height are different (this is targetted
  at textures containing animation frames where the height is a multiple of the width).
o Fixed: Display of textures where the height is greater than their width.

2 jul 05

v1.4.20

o Fixed: Program hanging when having two or more (groups of) segments that aren't connected.

o Fixed: Crash when restoring default texture if the replacement texture is a tga texture.
o New: Mine render depth slider.

24 jun 05

v1.4.17

o Fixed: Undoing block movements undid one vertex position change after the other instead of 
  reverting all marked vertices to their previous positions at once.
o Fixed: Couldn't set primary or secondary textures using the texture tool's texture dropdown boxes.
o Fixed: Deleting a cube deleted walls in adjacent cubes.

o Fixed: Couldn't process images >= 256x256 pixels.

23 jun 05

v1.4.15

o Changed: Vertigo missions will now use the name "zname" and D2X-W32 missions will
  now use "d2x-name" in mission files. That should take care of older program versions
  reading D2X-W32 missions and crashing when trying to display them.

22 jun 05

v1.4.14

o Fixed: Quad concussion missile pack images wasn't displayed in the object tool.

31 may 05

  shrunk and be surrounded by 6 new segments filling up the space previously occupied by the 
  source cube.

30 may 05

v1.4.3

o Fixed: DLE-XP couldn't handle textures > 128x128.

  go bogus.

  This allows to colorize all lights in a level by only setting the light color for 
  each light texture used once.
  Chose the setting in the preferences dialog.
  Texture colors can be transferred to light colors when calling the illumination 
  routine by checking "create side colors from textures" in the Light Tool.
o Fixed: DLE-XP will now preserve the alpha channel of TGA textures.

25 may 05

v1.4.0

o New: Support for TGA image files (max. size 1024x1024). DLE-XP will actually store TGA 
  images in POG files.
  DLE-XP will create temporary bitmap representations of such images to display them 
  during level editing. 
  D2X-W32 is capable of using TGA (RGB) images starting from v1.4.6.

  such textures when loading a mine.

13 feb 05

o Joining the current side with the closest other side did not work.

11 feb 05

v1.0.0.68

o Fixed DLE-XP erroneously placing lightmaps in hog files when no texture brightness was changed.

5 feb 05

v1.0.0.64

o A few semantics fixes after conversion to MSVC++ .NET

  allowing to make any texture a light texture. Using lightmaps goes per level, i.e. each level in
  a hog file can have its own lightmap. The corresponding lightmap files have the extension ".lgt".
  They will only be evaluated by DLE-XP. If a light map is changed, level lighting needs to be redone;
  DLE-XP will not do that automatically.

  if the edit bar was floating freely or closed, it will be restored in default state, i.e. docked
  right of the main tool bar).

1 may 04
