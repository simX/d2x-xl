//	Change the following constants to affect the look of the omega cannon.
//	Changing these constants will not affect the damage done.
//	WARNING: If you change DESIRED_OMEGA_DIST and MAX_OMEGA_BLOBS, you don't merely change the look of the cannon,
//	you change its range.  If you decrease DESIRED_OMEGA_DIST, you decrease how far the gun can fire.
#define	MIN_OMEGA_BLOBS		3				//	No matter how close the obstruction, at this many blobs created.
#define	MIN_OMEGA_DIST			(F1_0*3)		//	At least this distance between blobs, unless doing so would violate MIN_OMEGA_BLOBS
#define	DESIRED_OMEGA_DIST	(F1_0*5)		//	This is the desired distance between blobs.  For distances > MIN_OMEGA_BLOBS*DESIRED_OMEGA_DIST, but not very large, this will apply.
#define	MAX_OMEGA_BLOBS		16				//	No matter how far away the obstruction, this is the maximum number of blobs.
#define	MAX_OMEGA_DIST			(MAX_OMEGA_BLOBS * DESIRED_OMEGA_DIST)		//	Maximum extent of lightning blobs.

//	Additionally, several constants which apply to homing gameData.objs.objects in general control the behavior of the Omega Cannon.
//	They are defined in laser.h.  They are copied here for reference.  These values are valid on 1/10/96:
//	If you want the Omega Cannon view cone to be different than the Homing Missile viewcone, contact MK to make the change.
