2. Installing the program
--------------------------

2.1. Required packages

You will need to have the following modules installed:

SDL-devel
SDL_mixer-devel
SDL_image-devel
Mesa-devel
DirectFB

It is recommended to download the SDL and SDL_mixer source code from 
http://www.descent.de and to build and install SDL and SDL_mixer using these.
This is safe as it mainly fixes bugs in these libraries.

commands:

sh ./autogen.sh
chmod 0755 ./configure
./configure --enable-release=yes --enabled-debug=no
make


2.3 Updates

When updating the program, make sure to update the files from the latest D2X-XL
data release.
